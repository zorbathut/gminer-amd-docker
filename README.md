This is a Docker container for running gminer under AMD CPUs under Ubuntu 20.04. It has been used on exactly one system. You're welcome to use it! You'll need to tinker to make it work, but the hard work has honestly been done, unless your system works differently, which it might.

No documentation is provided; if you actually want documentation, ping me, I guess, and I'll write some up. Frankly, I suspect nobody except me will ever see this.
